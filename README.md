1. Inversion of Control(IOC) - is a programming principle that referers to share the depandacy responsibility by other object.
2. Dependency Inversion Principle(DIP) - DIP suggests that high-level modules should not depend on low level modules. Both should depend on abstraction.
3. Dependency Injection(DI) - Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern where you would have to passdown the depandant objects he needs.
4. IoC Container - The IoC container is a framework used to manage automatic dependency injection throughout the application, so that we as programmers do not need to put more time and effort into it.
